# RoboPaint Edit/Create mode
The default SVG Import and editing mode for RoboPaint

![Edit Mode](images/edit_preview_1.png?raw=true)

This module is a mode for [RoboPaint](https://github.com/evil-mad/robopaint),
the software for drawing robots, and your
[friendly painting robot kit, the WaterColorBot](http://watercolorbot.com)!

This project is based off of the open source
[method-draw](https://github.com/duopixel/Method-Draw) project for opening,
editing, and creating SVGs files for import into RoboPaint. It has a few rough
edges and doesn't always do what you want, and can complain in strange ways,
but most of the time it works, looks nice, and is happy.

More documentation and issues to come from the main RoboPaint project.
